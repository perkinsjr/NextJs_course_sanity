## NextJs Course Sanity Code

### How to use this?
Firstly you should be using this for only a reference and not copy and pasting the code as you won't learn anything, however.

Make sure you have a sanity account (https://sanity.io)

1. All schema code can be found in schema.js
2. Youtube can be found in the youtube.js
